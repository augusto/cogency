# Cogency

> **Agentic AI out of the box**

Cogency makes it dead simple to build multi-step reasoning agents. No complex configurations, no verbose setup - just clean, extensible agents that work.

## Quick Start

```python
from cogency.agent import Agent
from cogency.llm import GeminiLLM
from cogency.tools.calculator import CalculatorTool

llm = GeminiLLM(api_key="your-key")
agent = Agent(name="MyAgent", llm=llm, tools=[CalculatorTool()])

result = agent.run("What is 15 * 23?", enable_trace=True)
print(result["response"])
```

## Why Cogency?

- **Zero config** - Agents in 6 lines of code
- **Auto-discovery** - Drop tools in `/tools/` and they just work
- **Clean tracing** - See exactly what your agent is thinking
- **Multi-step reasoning** - Built-in plan â†’ reason â†’ act â†’ reflect â†’ respond loop
- **Extensible** - Add new LLMs and tools easily

## Language Support

- **Python** - Full-featured implementation
- **JavaScript** - Coming soon

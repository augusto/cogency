# Cogency Examples

Clean, focused examples showcasing core AI agent capabilities.

## ðŸš€ Core Examples

### `coding.py` - Code Generation
```bash
python coding.py
```
Simple coding agent demonstrating code generation capabilities.

### `research.py` - Deep Research
```bash
python research.py
```
Multi-step research with longer horizon planning and comprehensive analysis.

### `memory.py` - Persistent Memory
```bash
python memory.py
```
Save and recall information across conversations.

### `chat.py` - Interactive Chat
```bash
python chat.py
```

## Core Capabilities

Each example demonstrates different core functionalities:

- **`coding.py`**: Basic code generation and problem solving
- **`research.py`**: Deep research with adaptive reasoning (Fastâ†’Deep React)
- **`memory.py`**: Persistent memory across conversations
- **`chat.py`**: Interactive experience with all capabilities

All examples use streaming for real-time feedback and clean output formatting.

## Getting Started

1. Start with `coding.py` for basic code generation
2. Try `research.py` to see adaptive reasoning and deep analysis
3. Use `memory.py` to see persistent memory in action
4. Run `chat.py` for full interactive experience

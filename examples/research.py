Research the current state of AGI/ASI development and provide a comprehensive analysis:

1. Search for recent developments in AGI research and timeline predictions (2024-2025)
2. Find information about current ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) theoretical frameworks
3. Research the "AI singularity" concept and expert predictions
4. Investigate both accelerationist and doomerist perspectives on AI development
5. Calculate investment trends if you can find funding data for AGI companies
6. Save comprehensive findings to 'agi_analysis_2025.txt'

Synthesize conflicting expert opinions and present a balanced analysis with sources.
This topic requires navigating contested claims, rapid developments, and diverse perspectives.

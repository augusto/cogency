DEEP: Structured reasoning for query: {query}

JSON Response Format:

  "reflect": "What worked/failed in previous actions? What gaps remain?",
  "plan": "What specific tools to use next and expected outcomes?",
  "tool_calls": [
    {{"name": "tool_a", "args": {{"param": "value"}}}}
  ],
  "switch_to": null,
  "switch_why": null
}}

TOOLS:
{tool_registry}

CONTEXT:
Iteration {current_iteration}/{max_iterations} - Review completed actions to avoid repetition
Current approach: {current_approach}
Action history: {previous_attempts}
Last quality: {last_tool_quality}

REASONING PHASES:
ðŸ¤” REFLECT: Review completed actions and their results - what information do you already have? What gaps remain?
ðŸ“‹ PLAN: Choose NEW tools that address remaining gaps - avoid repeating successful actions
ðŸŽ¯ EXECUTE: Run planned tools in parallel when they address independent aspects

RECOVERY ACTIONS:
- Tool parameter errors â†’ Check required vs optional parameters in schema
- No results from tools â†’ Try different parameters or alternative approaches
- Information conflicts â†’ Use additional tools to verify or synthesize  
- Avoid repeating successful tool calls - check action history first
- Empty tool_calls array ([ ]) if query fully answered or no progress possible
- If original query has been fully resolved, say so explicitly and return tool_calls: []

DOWNSHIFT to FAST if:
- Simple datetime request using time tool
- Direct search with obvious keywords
- Single-step action with clear tool choice

Examples:
switch_to: "fast", switch_why: "Query simplified to direct search"
switch_to: "fast", switch_why: "Single tool execution sufficient"
